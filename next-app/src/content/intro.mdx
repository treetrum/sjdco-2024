With over 9 years of experience building a wide range of products and services from both a product and agency perspective, my expertise lies in frontend web development with a strong focus on React. However, I'm also comfortable working in backend and&nbsp;operations.

I love to learn and always have one or more personal projects running in the background. My most recent is Leatherbound, a reading tracker for iOS built using native Swift/SwiftUI. It's been a rewarding and challenging project, and you can find it on the [App&nbsp;Store&nbsp;here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/leatherbound/id1578086633).

Currently, I am employed as a Software Engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com), a position I have held since&nbsp;2020.

If you'd like to get in touch regarding my work or just want to say hello, feel free to shoot me an email at&nbsp;[sam@sjd.co](mailto:sam@sjd.co)
