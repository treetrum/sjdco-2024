Hey <span className="text-white">ðŸ‘‹</span> I'm Sam Davis, a web developer based in Sydney, Australia.

With over 7 years of experience building a wide range of products and services from both a product and agency perspective, my specialty lies in frontend web development with a strong focus on React. However, I'm also comfortable working across the full stack.

I love to learn and always have one or more personal projects running in the background. My most recent one is Leatherbound, a reading tracker for iOS built using native Swift/SwiftUI. It's been a fun and challenging project, and you can find it on the [App Store here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/leatherbound/id1578086633).

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com), where I've been since 2020.

If you'd like to get in touch regarding my work or just want to say hello, feel free to shoot me an email at [sam@sjd.co](mailto:sam@sjd.co)
